# HIRO at Oregon State University

Static landing page for the Humanoid & Intelligent Robotics Organization (HIRO), a robotics club at Oregon State University.

## Local development

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, *or* run a lightweight server:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 4000
   ```

   Then visit `http://localhost:4000` to preview before pushing.
2. Edit `assets/css/styles.css` for styling tweaks or update the HTML directly for content changes.

No build tools are required—everything is plain HTML/CSS so it can be hosted directly on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html` — main page markup.
- `projects/` — standalone detail pages for flagship projects.
- `assets/css` — site stylesheets.
- `assets/images` — club branding, sponsor logos, and project imagery (`projects/so101`, `projects/actuator`, etc.).
